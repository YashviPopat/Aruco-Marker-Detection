## Overview
This project focuses on ArUco marker detection using OpenCV, a computer vision library. The system identifies and tracks ArUco markers in real-time from video streams or images, enabling applications such as augmented reality and robotic navigation. The implementation includes calibration of camera parameters for accurate detection and provides visualization of detected markers with their corresponding IDs, enhancing the understanding of spatial relationships in a given environment.

## Requirements
OpenCV:

Install OpenCV with contrib modules (required for ArUco marker detection).

    pip install opencv-contrib-python

Alternatively, if you're using an older version of OpenCV:

pip install opencv-contrib-python==4.5.5.64
NumPy:

    pip install numpy
Matplotlib (optional):

If you want to visualize the image using matplotlib (not used in the current code but helpful for debugging).

    pip install matplotlib

Python Version:

Python 3.6 or higher.
